# Pontem Wallet

Pontem wallet is the bridge into Aptos and the rest of web3.
Access all your favorite Aptos web3 apps directly from your browser extension. 
Through the Pontem wallet, users can create and manage private keys to access cryptocurrency tokens like APTOS and USDC.

The proposal for the current repository is to publish:

* Development builds.
* Production builds before it meets stores. 
* Urgent updates.
